Abandoned cart recovery emails are a great way of recovering lost sales. With that said, it becomes quite harder to stand out in the user's inbox.

What if you could customise your abandoned cart emails on-the-go with the help of templates?
Sounds great, isn't it? 

We all like extra choices, don't we?
With the premium plan of Retainful you could get access to more abandoned cart email templates.

**What the free plan offers?**

With the Free plan of Retainful,  you will have access to 3 email templates as follows:

You could unlock other templates by subscribing to the Premium plans.

Though the Free plan provides the facility to use templates, it feels good to choose from few more options. You can get this added advantage in the Premium plans.
